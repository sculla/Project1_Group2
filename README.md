# Project1_Group2 -- Metis MTA Project

## Making a Feature Branch for your contribution:
When making a branch for your part of the project, please use the feature/<your branch name> to denote your part of the project. After the successful completion of the feature, we will merge it to the develop branch.  
With this, we are able to easily each work off of a single branch, develop, and have our features able to be pushed back to that branch for the full integration. 

Please let me know if you're having any issues with this, I've included a link here to review as well [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
